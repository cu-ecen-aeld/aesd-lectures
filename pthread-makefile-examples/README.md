# Pthread and Makefile Tutorial

This directory contains simple programs that serves as a tutorial for pthreads and makefile. \

## 1. Pthread: Creating threads. Makefile: Target, Dependencies, Recipes and Rules

### Brief 
This directory contains two programs, 1_thread_create.c and 2_thread_create.c. 

1_thread_create.c is used to create a thread, "threadFunc" which prints the process ID of the thread. \
It is important to note that the process ID of main thread and threadFunc are the same as threads run within the context of a single process. \

2_thread_create.c is used to introduce how to terminate a thread using pthread_exit(). 

### Build
Executable files can be generated by the use of the provided makefile. \
This makefile explains the following concepts with examples: Targets, Dependencies, Recipes and Rules. 

### Expected Output

1_thread_create.c:

## 2. Pthread: Joining Threads. Makefile: Macros, PHONY Targets

### Brief
This directory contains one program only, "1_threadjoin.c", which explains how threads can be joined to parent thread. 

### Build
Executable files can be generated by the use of the provided makefile. \
This makefile explains the following concepts with examples: Macros and PHONY Targets

### Expected Output

## 3. Pthread: Detaching and Canceling threads. Makefile: Automatic variables, Pattern Rule

### Brief
THis directory contains two programs, 1_threaddetach.c and 2_threadcancel.c. 

1_threaddetach.c explains how a thread can detach itself from a parent thread using pthread_detach(). 
2_threadcancel.c explains how a thread can be canceled/terminated from another thread using pthread_cancel(). 

### Build
Executable files can be generated by the use of the provided makefile. \
This makefile explains the follwing concepts: Automatic variables, Pattern Rules

### Expected Outptut
